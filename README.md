# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
NLP text problem - to predict which tweet is positive or negative sentiment. The data is in a TSV format where the label is the first value followed by the tweet.
I have performed NLP - data mining on this dataset using "tm" library of R.
For modelling I have used Logistic Regression ,Naive Bayes and Random Forest.
Also with a 10 k-fold cross-validation and AUC score study.

In Random forest AUC score is maximum.
